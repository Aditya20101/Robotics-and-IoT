Remote controlled robot/car with Raspberry Pi and Alphabot kit using -

1) android application "Rootsaid" with real time camera feed using Pi-camera. 

2) using Blynk app.


## IoT based Precision Agriculture

The system measures soil moisture (using FC-28 resistive capacitive sensor), environment temperature and humidity (using DHT11 sensor), water temperature (DS18B20 temperature sensor) and TDS value of water sample. Then this sensed data is transferred to the microcontroller (Node MCU) and which is then transferred to the cloud using inbuilt ESP8266-12E wifi module. The mobile app (Blynk) enables us to moniter the above mentioned parameters and store them in the cloud ( Blynk server). for further analysis. The app gives the user notification when the moisture level is below a threshold level. Notification is also sent when the TDS sensor and water temperature sensor are placed in a water sample consisting of the TDS value of the sample.
